## About
A basic angular application to demonstrate how to run Hello Angular with its ecosystem.

There are two parts to understand here.
1. For firsts, you can always clone this repo and run it locally to get your Hello Angular app going.
2. Or, you can learn how to build this yourself from scratch.

Once you know how to stand an application up from scratch, you can use this as a template to build upon for any future more fun applications.

### Getting Started
````` npm init
npm install --save 'packagename' `````

'npm init' will genereate a package.json file for you.
'--save' will write the dependency in your package.
